Miu2D is a **160,000-line** 2D ARPG engine written in TypeScript and Rust, rendering through **raw WebGL** with no dependency on Unity, Godot, Phaser, PixiJS, or any other game framework. Every subsystem — sprite batching, A* pathfinding, binary format decoders, scripting VM, weather particles, screen effects — is implemented from first principles.

As a proof of concept, Miu2D has been used to rebuild **three classic Kingsoft (西山居) wuxia RPGs**, all fully playable in any modern browser.

> **Vibe Coding** — This project is developed with AI-assisted programming from day one.

## Why Build a Game Engine from Scratch?

Most web game projects reach for PixiJS, Phaser, or a WASM-compiled Unity/Godot build. Miu2D takes a different path: the entire rendering pipeline talks directly to `WebGLRenderingContext`, the pathfinder lives in Rust compiled to WASM with zero-copy shared memory, and the scripting engine interprets 182 game commands through a custom parser/executor pair. The result is a system whose every layer is visible, debuggable, and tailored to 2D RPG mechanics.

**What this buys you:**

- **Full control over the render loop** — a `SpriteBatcher` coalesces ~4,800 map tile draws into 1–5 WebGL draw calls; a `RectBatcher` reduces ~300 weather particles to a single call.
- **No abstraction tax** — no unused scene graph, no 3D math overhead, no framework event model to work around.
- **Rust-speed where it matters** — A* pathfinding runs in ~0.2 ms via WASM with obstacle data written directly into linear memory (no serialization, no FFI copy).
- **Clean architecture for study** — a 7-level class hierarchy (Sprite → CharacterBase → Movement → Combat → Character → PlayerBase → PlayerCombat → Player) with clear separation of concerns, ideal for understanding how a full 2D RPG engine works under the hood.

## Engine Systems

Miu2D implements **17 integrated ARPG subsystems** entirely from first principles:

| System | Module | Highlights |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Rendering** | `renderer/` | Raw WebGL sprite batcher (~4,800 tiles → 1–5 draw calls), Canvas2D fallback, GLSL color filters (poison / freeze / petrify), screen effects (fade, flash, water ripple), **local lighting** (additive lum masks for dark scenes) |

## Engine Deep Dive

### Renderer — Raw WebGL with Automatic Batching

The renderer is **685 lines** of direct `WebGLRenderingContext` calls — no wrapper library.

- **SpriteBatcher** — accumulates vertex data and flushes per texture change; typical map frame: ~4,800 tiles → 1–5 draw calls
- **RectBatcher** — weather particles and UI rectangles batched into a single draw call
- **GPU texture management** — `ImageData` → `WebGLTexture` with `WeakMap` caching and `FinalizationRegistry` for automatic GPU resource cleanup
- **GLSL color filters** — grayscale (petrification), blue tint (frozen), green tint (poison) applied per-sprite in the fragment shader
- **Screen effects** — fade in/out, color overlays, screen flash, water ripple, all composited in the render loop
- **Canvas 2D fallback** — same `Renderer` interface, full feature parity for devices without WebGL
- **Local lighting (LumMask)** — when `SetMainLum` darkens the scene, light-emitting entities (objects, NPCs, magic projectiles) generate an additive white 800×400 elliptical glow mask at their position. A per-tile dedup (matching C++ `Weather::drawElementLum`) prevents double-drawing. A `noLum` flag on magic sub-projectiles suppresses redundant light sources for dense spell patterns, accurately matching the C++ reference:
  - **LineMove**: 1-in-3 sub-projectiles emit light (`i % 3 === 1`)
  - **Square region**: 1-in-9 (`i % 3 === 1 && j % 3 === 1`)
  - **Wave / Rectangle region**: 1-in-4 (`i % 2 !== 0 && j % 2 !== 0`)
  - **CircleMove** (e.g. 依风剑法): 1-in-8 of the 32 projectiles emit light

### Script Engine — 182 Commands

A custom **parser** tokenizes game script files; an **executor** interprets them with blocking/async support. Commands span 9 categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Dialog | `Say`, `Talk`, `Choose`, `ChooseMultiple`, `DisplayMessage` |
| Player | `AddLife`, `AddMana`, `SetPlayerPos`, `PlayerGoto`, `Equip` |
| NPC | `AddNpc`, `DelNpc`, `SetNpcRelation`, `NpcAttack`, `MergeNpc` |
| Game State | `LoadMap`, `Assign`, `If/Goto`, `RunScript`, `RunParallelScript` |
| Audio | `PlayMusic`, `StopMusic`, `PlaySound` |
| Effects | `FadeIn`, `FadeOut`, `BeginRain`, `ShowSnow`, `OpenWaterEffect` |
| Objects | `AddObj`, `DelObj`, `OpenObj`, `SetObjScript` |
| Items | `AddGoods`, `DelGoods`, `ClearGoods`, `AddRandGoods` |
| Misc | `Sleep`, `Watch`, `PlayMovie`, `DisableInput`, `ReturnToTitle` |

Scripts drive the entire game narrative — cutscenes, branching dialogs, NPC spawning, map transitions, combat triggers, and weather changes.

### Magic System — 22 Movement Types × 10 Special Effects

Every magic attack follows one of **22 MoveKind** trajectories, each with its own physics and rendering:

| Movement | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| LineMove | Multi-projectile line — count scales with level |
| CircleMove | Orbital ring pattern |
| SpiralMove | Expanding spiral outward |
| SectorMove | Fan-shaped spread |
| HeartMove | Heart-shaped flight path |
| FollowEnemy | Homing missile tracking |
| Throw | Parabolic arc projectile |
| Transport | Teleportation |
| Summon | Spawn allied NPC |
| TimeStop | Freeze all entities |
| VMove | V-shaped diverging spread |
| *...and 11 more* | |

Combined with **10 SpecialKind** effects (freeze, poison, petrify, invisibility, heal, buff, transform, remove-debuff…), this produces hundreds of unique spell combinations. The system includes specialized sprite factories, a collision handler, and a passive effect manager (XiuLian/修炼).

### Pathfinding — Rust WASM, Zero-Copy Memory

The A* pathfinder is **1,144 lines of Rust**, compiled to WebAssembly. It eliminates all FFI overhead through shared linear memory:

1. JavaScript writes obstacle bitmaps directly into WASM linear memory via `Uint8Array` views on `wasm.memory.buffer`
2. WASM executes A* in-place on shared memory
3. JavaScript reads path results via `Int32Array` pointer views — **zero serialization, zero copying**

Five path strategies (from greedy to full A* with configurable max iterations) let the game trade accuracy for speed. Typical pathfind: **~0.2 ms**, roughly **10× faster** than the equivalent TypeScript implementation.

### Binary Format Decoders

The engine parses **8 binary file formats** from the original game — all reverse-engineered and implemented without third-party parsing libraries:

| Format | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **ASF** | Sprite animation frames (RLE-compressed, palette-indexed RGBA) |
| **MPC** | Resource pack container (bundled sprite sheets) |
| **MAP** | Tile map data (multiple layers, obstacle grid, trap zones) |
| **SHD** | Shadow / height map data for terrain |
| **XNB** | XNA Binary format (audio assets from the original game) |
| **MSF** | Miu Sprite Format v2 — custom indexed-palette + zstd compression |
| **MMF** | Miu Map Format — custom zstd-compressed binary map data |
| **INI/OBJ** | Config files in GBK (Chinese legacy encoding) and UTF-8 |

### Weather System — Particle-Driven

**1,533 LOC** of particle physics and rendering:

- **Rain** — wind-affected particles with splash on contact, periodic lightning flash illuminating the scene
- **Screen droplets** — simulated refraction/lens effect of water running down the camera
- **Snow** — individual snowflake physics with wobble, spin, drift, and gradual melt

### Character System — 7-Level Inheritance

A deep, well-structured class hierarchy with clear separation of concerns:

```
Sprite (615 LOC)
 └─ CharacterBase (961) — stats, properties, status flags
     └─ CharacterMovement (1,057) — A* pathfinding, tile walking, bezier curves
         └─ CharacterCombat (780) — attack, damage calc, status effects
             └─ Character (980) — shared NPC/Player logic [abstract]
                 ├─ PlayerBase → PlayerCombat → Player (2,698 combined)
                 └─ Npc (658) — AI behavior, interaction scripts, spatial grid
```
